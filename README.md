**A rag-tag bunch of misfits brought together by the desire to make a difference with some ideas and code**

This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to detect road traffic accidents through closed-circuit television (CCTV) feeds.

## The problem

According to the World Health Organisation[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries), delays in detecting and providing care for those involved in a road traffic accident increases the severity of injuries. Care of injuries after an accident has occurred is extremely time-sensitive: with delays of minutes making the difference between life and death. The World Health Organisation also recommends quicker access to prehospital care as a possible solution, and we have devised a two-pronged approach to improving access to emergency medical services for people who have just been in a road traffic accident

### The idea

To provide quicker access to emergency medical services, an increase in resources during times of high demand and
