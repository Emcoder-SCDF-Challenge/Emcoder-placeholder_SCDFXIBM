# Emcoder-placeholder_SCDFXIBM
**A rag-tag bunch of misfits brought together by the desire to make a difference with some ideas and code**

This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to detect road traffic accidents through closed-circuit television (CCTV) feeds.

## The problem

Every day, dedicated officers of the Singapore Civil Defence Force work tirelessly to mitigate and respond to emergencies that spring up across the island. In 2019, about 10,400 emergency calls were directly related to road traffic accidents, averaging 29 calls a day for that year. Despite the 3.3% drop in fatalities on the road, incidents such as speeding, red-light running, and accidents involving elderly pedestrians and motorcyclists increase the risk of accidents and injury. Between 2018 and 2019, these incidents have been on the rise. 

Singapore has made significant strides in ensuring our roads are safe even by international standards. However, the fact remains that each emergency call made for non-fatal road accidents draws precious emergency resources away from responding to calls for trauma emergencies especially with our ageing population. If we are able to hit null on the cases of road accidents, that will free up manpower and other resources in the SCDF for our volatile future.


### The idea

In response to the backdrop described, Team Emcoder, has created and conceptualise a system called CEASE (Comprehensive Early Action Sensing for Emergency). It is a system for SCDF to target early intervention measures in a two-pronged approach. Each prong aims to optimize the use of SCDF’s resources. 
1. Comprehensive Hotspot Prediction
1. Continuous Accident Monitoring

Our system leverages sensors and data that has already been installed or collected along all of Singapore’s roads, such as the Land Transport Authority's API for live traffic conditions[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall/dynamic-data.html)
We are proposing a system to decide when and where early intervention measures can be placed that will be the most efficient use of our precious emergency resources. Although we are not preaching a method to bring road accidents down to 0, we see this as an optimization problem to target and concentrate SCDF’s resources to make the greatest impact.
