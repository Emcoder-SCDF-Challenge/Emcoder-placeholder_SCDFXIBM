# CEASE in-depth

## The problem
With SCDF's limited emergency medical resources, each emergency call made for non-fatal road accidents draws precious emergency resources away from trauma emergencies, with delays of minutes being the difference between life and death. Two issues in particular contribute to this problem:

1. **<u>Accidents occuring during times with low vehicle and foot traffic will have extended delays in access to emergency medical services due to the lack of reporting</u>**
- 

2. **<u>Resources are not optimised for peaks and troughs in demand for emergency medical services</u>**
-


## Our Analysis:

We propose the usage of IoT to tackle the 3 problems highlighted above.

**OUR SOLUTION:**

We propose that the rotation system needs to be better automated to reduce human error of tracking and recording timing of firefighters, and to provide a more accurate judgement of the conditions of the personnel.
