# CEASE Alert Notification

CEASE Alert Notification aims to leverage on smart infrastructures to allow SCDF to deploy help immediately to accident sites with little to no time delay. We hope to leverage a network of smart infrastructure to respond to emergency timely, saving lifes. Additionally, we would like to take precautionary measures by analysing available dataset to narrow down frequent timing of accidents happening. This valuable information can be used to better allocate manpower, ensuring the availability of resources when needed.

## Accident detection system through live CCTV footage

Using IBM Watson's visual recognition software, we can analyse still images from the CCTV footage to detect for traffic. If true, the image will then be analysed to see if an accident has occurred. This information can then be relayed to SCDF Ops Center to allow for faster deployment of emergency medical services.

## Data Analysis of Details of Past Accidents

Using Machine Learning and Data Analysis, we can create heatmap to show concentration of accidents happening throughout the day, throughout the month, as well as throughout the year. This may allow SCDF to better roster their shift works and even helps with the allocation of leaves throughout the year.

### Future Implementation

For future implementation, we may include locations of accidents. By adding more variables, it can further narrow down the scope. Additionally, we may connect it to live NEA information, such as the weather, and GPS application of drivers, to alert them when they are driving in accident-favourable situations, for them to drive even more cautiously.
